to run the program type "python main.py" on the command line

after running the program you will be prompted to enter information about how to train the neural net.

        population size (integer > 0):
        training iterations (integer >= 0/enter 0 to not train):
        testing iterations (integer >= 0/enter 0 to not test):
        would you like to randomize the initial weights (Y/N):
        choose the csv file you want to imort the weights from (eg: "data.csv"): #only appears if you answered 'N' to the above question
        would you like to save the final weights of the best snake? (Y/N):
        choose the csv file you want to save the weights to (eg: "data.csv"): #only appears if you answered 'Y' to the above question

A csv file of neural net weights that have already been trained using this program has been provided (data.csv). 
You can use this file or you can train your own neural net. If you want to just test and see the neural net in the 
data.csv file answer the prompts as follows:

        population size (integer > 0): 1
        training iterations (integer >= 0/enter 0 to not train): 0
        testing iterations (integer >= 0/enter 0 to not test): 100
        would you like to randomize the initial weights (Y/N): N
        choose the csv file you want to imort the weights from (eg: "data.csv"): data.csv
        would you like to save the final weights of the best snake? (Y/N): N
        press enter to begin: <enter>
        
This will not train a neural net, but instead inject the data from data.csv into its own neural net, test that 
neural net 100 times, give you the average/max length of the snake in those 100 iteration, then open a window 
where you can see the neural net play the game.
